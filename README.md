# 📊 Social Media vs Productivity – ML Regression Project

This project explores how digital habits (social media usage, notifications, screen time) relate to productivity and stress levels using machine learning.

## 📁 Dataset
Contains 30,000 real-world-style records with features like:
- Daily screen time
- Sleep hours
- Notifications
- Productivity scores
- Stress level

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict `actual_productivity_score` and `stress_level`
- Compare 5 regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - SVR
  - XGBoost

## 🛠️ ML Pipeline
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training (on 2 targets)
4. Evaluation & Comparison

## 📚 Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
